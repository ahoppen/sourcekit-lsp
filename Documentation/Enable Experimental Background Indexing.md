# Background Indexing

Background indexing in SourceKit-LSP is available as an experimental feature. This guide shows how to set up background indexing and which caveats to expect.

> [!WARNING]
> Background indexing is still an experimental feature and still has some non-trivial limitations and bugs (see the known issues).

## Set Up

Background indexing is still under active, rapid development, so please build SourceKit-LSP from the `main` branch using the following commands. Things are changing rapidly, so rebuilding daily is not a bad practice.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/apple/sourcekit-lsp.git
$ cd sourcekit-lsp
$ swift package update
$ swift build -c release
```

Next, point your editor to use the just-built copy of SourceKit-LSP and enable background indexing by passing `--experimental-feature background-indexing` to sourcekit-lsp. In VS Code, this can be done by adding the following to your settings.json
```json
"swift.sourcekit-lsp.serverPath": "/path/to/sourcekit-lsp/.build/release/sourcekit-lsp",
"swift.sourcekit-lsp.serverArguments": [ "--experimental-feature", "background-indexing" ],
```

Background indexing requires a Swift 6 toolchain. You can download Swift 6 nightly toolchains from https://www.swift.org/download/#swift-60-development.

## Known issues

- Not really a background indexing related issue but Swift nightly toolchain snapshots are crashing on macOS 14.4 and 14.5 (swift#73327)[https://github.com/apple/swift/issues/73327]
  - Workaround: Run the toolchains on an older version of macOS, if possible
- Background Indexing is only supported for SwiftPM projects [#1269](https://github.com/apple/sourcekit-lsp/issues/1269), [#1271](https://github.com/apple/sourcekit-lsp/issues/1271)
- If a module or one of its dependencies has a compilation error, it cannot be properly prepared for indexing because we are running a regular `swift build` to generate its modules [#1254](https://github.com/apple/sourcekit-lsp/issues/1254) rdar://128683404
  - Workaround: Ensure that your files dependencies are in a buildable state to get an up-to-date index and proper cross-module functionality
- If you change a function in a way that changes its USR but keeps it API compatible (such as adding a defaulted parameter), references to it will be lost and not re-indexed automatically [#1264](https://github.com/apple/sourcekit-lsp/issues/1264)
  - Workaround: Make some edit to the files that had references to re-index them
- The index build is currently completely separate from the command line build generated using `swift build`. Building *does not* update the index (break your habits of always building!) [#1270](https://github.com/apple/sourcekit-lsp/issues/1270)
- The initial indexing might take 2-3x more time than a regular build [#1254](https://github.com/apple/sourcekit-lsp/issues/1254), [#1262](https://github.com/apple/sourcekit-lsp/issues/1262), [#1268](https://github.com/apple/sourcekit-lsp/issues/1268)
- Spurious re-indexing of ~10-20 source files when `swift build` writes a header to the build directory [rdar://128573306](rdar://128573306)

## Filing issues

If you hit any issues that are not mentioned above, please [file a GitHub issue](https://github.com/apple/sourcekit-lsp/issues/new/choose) and attach the following information, if possible:
- A diagnostic bundle generated by running `path/to/sourcekit-lsp diagnose --toolchain path/to/the/toolchain/you/are/using`
- Your project including the `.index-build` folder.
